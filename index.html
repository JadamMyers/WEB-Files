      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>I'm a Junior studying CTD and Computer Science. I get excited about design,
        whether that be rendering a new idea
        <br>for a product or sewing, stitching, and remixing clothes.
        I'm eager to learn how to create and design websites and front-ends of apps.
        <br>Outside of school, I do a lot of blockchain development and
        I love playing and watching all sports especially basketball and golf!</p>
